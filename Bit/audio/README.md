# Audio assets

Place audio files here for use in the Bit toy (e.g. pre-recorded "Yes" / "No" instead of speech synthesis).

**Suggested filenames** (used by the app if you switch to file playback):

- `yes.mp3` or `yes.ogg` — "Yes"
- `no.mp3` or `no.ogg` — "No"

Reference from JS: `audio/yes.mp3`, `audio/no.mp3` (paths relative to the site root).
